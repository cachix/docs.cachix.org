Telemetry
=========

Cachix Server supports exporting telemetry data using the `OpenTelemetry <https://opentelemetry.io/>`_ API.

We currently support the following `signals <https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/>`_:

* ✅ `Traces <https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/>`_
* ❌ `Metrics <https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/metrics/>`_
* ❌ `Logs <https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/logs/>`_

The default service name for the server is ``cachix-server``. Cachix-specific attributes are prefixed with ``cachix``.
